libservicelog:
--------------
The libservicelog package contains a library to create and maintain a database
for storing events related to system service. This database allows for the
logging of serviceable and informational events, and for the logging of service
procedures that have been performed upon the system.

Note:
  - Package name may differ slightly between Linux distributors. Ex: RedHat and
    SLES ships development packages as "-devel" while Ubuntu ships it as "-dev"
    package. Please check your linux distribution package naming convention and
    make sure you have installed right packages.

Building:
---------
You can build on Power Linux system.

$ ./bootstrap.sh
$ ./configure [--prefix=/usr/]
$ make
$ make install

Building rpms:
--------------
To build a tarball to feed to rpmbuild, do

$ make dist-gzip

As an example, we use a command similar to the following:

$ rpmbuild -ba [--target=ppc/ppc64] <path-to-spec-file>

Hacking:
--------
All patches should be sent to the mailing list with linux-kernel style
'Signed-Off-By'. The following git commands are your friends:
- git commit -s
- git format-patch

You probably want to read the linux Documentation/SubmittingPatches as
much of it applies to libservicelog.

Submitting patch:
-----------------
We use same mailing list for all Power Linux VPD and diagnostics projects
(ppc64-diag, libvpd, lsvpd, [lib]servicelog). It is common convention to
prefix your subject line with project name. This lets maintainer and other
developers more easily identify patches from patches targeted to other
projects. For example,

  Subject: [libservicelog PATCH 01/10] Summary phrase
